== Quick Synopsis

We came up with a series of tests to ensure that the PAPRa would be performant.  Performant means:

1.  When worn, the wearer received N99 levels of protection. link:testing_march_2021[This page] describes how we did that testing in March of 2021 on both individual fan units and on a tester wearing the entire PAPRa.
2.  The unit must maintain positive pressure under operating conditions.  This pressure requirement supercedes past flow requirements for two reasons: 1, it is hard to measure flow accurately, and 2, if the wearer is able to breathe more than the flow of the device, even if the device meets some standard flow rate, then the device would not protect the wearer.  link:pressure_testing_oct_2022[As of October 2022], these devices to appear to exceed the 4 CFM flow requirement, and require that the potentiometer be set such that the pressure in the system exceeds that of the wearer's inhalation.  That previous 4 CFM requirement comes from Hooded PAPRs require a flow of 6 CFM; since the PAPRa is designed to provide airflow for a half facepiece, the flow requirement is 4 CFM, or 113.27 L/minfootnote:[link:https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/378601O/interpretation-of-inhalation-airflow-measurements.pdf[Interpretation of Inhalation Airflow Measurements for Respirator Design and Testing.

== WARNING

Before you wear a PAPRa in any kind of potentially hazardous situation, it is critical that you test it to ensure that the unit is performing at an adequate level.  We have personally worn these units for many hours and tested these units to ensure an N99 level of performance, but we cannot guarantee that the units you make will perform at the same levels.  We provide no warranty, implicit or explicit, that any such units will provide protection.  Please make sure to test your units accordingly and to your own level of comfort and in compliance with whatever local regulations require.
