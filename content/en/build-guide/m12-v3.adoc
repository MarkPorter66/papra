  How-To guide for building the Tetra PAPRa m12 battery controller (Late January 2021 version).
---

== Quick Synopsis

The Tetra Powered Air Purified Respirator requires power to function, and the m12 battery controller provides that power for these models.  The controller consists of internal circuitry, a potentiometer to adjust fan speeds, a cable to connect to the fan box, and a port for a Milwaulkee M12 Battery to be inserted.

This build differs from the v1 version in that it uses a custom-built circuitboard to remove many of the difficult steps of the build, add a battery charge indicator, and a separate power port for use in a car.  If you cannot get the custom board (found in this repository: https://github.com/tetrabiodistributed/PAPRA-PCB), then please refer to the v1 version of this guide.

== Parts Required

This build will require printed parts, purchased parts, and several tools.  Here is a picture of all the components used in this build:

This is the assembly diagram of the controller itself:

== Build Instructions

Building this version of the controller is more a matter of ensuring that the Controller Box was printed cleanly and all support material is properly removed.  

Remove the support material:

Test that the board can be seated into the controller body:

Seat the Plate on the board:

Place the washer over the power port, and then finger tighten a hex nut over the same power port to hold the Plate in place:

Tighten the complex down with a tool, being careful not to overly tighten and damage the board:

Separate the light pipe from the board:

Seat the board into the Controller Box:

Place the light pipe onto the board:

Place washers and nuts on both external components of the Controller Box, and tighten with the socket wrench:

Place the light clip over the light pipe, and secure in place using pliers to pull the clip over the top of the pipe:

Place the Knob onto the potentiometer, and twist to turn on.  If there is a charged battery in the Controller, you should see the lights in the light pipe:

Snap the Lid in place.  Note the orientation; snapping the lid in in the opposite orientation may cause the lower lip to break off:
