*WARNING:* we provide no warranty, implicit or explicit, that this device will work up to an N95 specification, when built outside of a facility rated to do so.  The only way to truly test one of these devices using something like a https://tsi.com/products/respirator-fit-testers/portacount-respirator-fit-tester-8038/[Portacount] under controlled conditions.

== Build Steps

Once the PAPRa has been built, it should be worn.  This guide provides a simple way to put components together in an over-the-shoulder configuration.  The Fan Box has multiple attachment points, so other configurations are possible-- and please let us know if you come up with something you really like!

Cut the webbing into roughly 2 foot strips.

Weave the strap into the box base plate and the MOLLE adaptors:

Use triglides to hold the straps in place:
